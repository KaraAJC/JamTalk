## Context
### Motivation
This app is inspired by the worksheets from an Autostraddle Article: http://www.autostraddle.com/you-need-help-here-is-a-worksheet-to-help-you-talk-to-partners-about-sex-237385/
I really wanted to be able to have the ease of documenting this info for yourself and then being able to ask someone else to take time to think about it for themselves. then have a way to discuss what comes out of it, in a smart way.
